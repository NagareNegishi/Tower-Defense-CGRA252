# Game Description
What is the style of the game, what are similar games
- Tower Defense similar to Bloons TD

[THIS IS TEMPORARY]
<TEMP>
Our game is a classic 2D Tower Defense (TD) strategy game,
drawing inspiration from popular title Bloons TD.
The game combines strategic placement of defensive structures with resource management (and quick decision-making).
Like Bloons TD, our game will feature a variety of tower types, each with unique abilities and upgrade.

What is the main game mechanic
- Before each round player sets up and upgrades towers
- Enemies spwan in waves and try to reach players base
- Player takes damage for every enemy that makes it through to base
- When base health reaches 0 game is over

**Pre-round Setup**:
- Players strategically place towers on the map before each wave begins
- Limited resources (money/points) for purchasing and upgrading towers
- Players can sell or relocate towers to adapt their strategy
**Wave-based Enemy Spawns**:
- Diverse enemy types with different speeds, health, and abilities
- Progressively challenging waves that test the player's defense
**Player Base and Health System**:
- Path end that players must protect
- Base health decreases when enemies reach it
- Game over when base health reaches zero
**Tower Mechanics**:
- Multiple tower types (e.g., projectile, area-of-effect, support)
- Upgrade for each tower, enhancing damage, range, or special abilities
**Resource Management**:
- Earn in-game currency by defeating enemies
- Balance between saving for powerful upgrades and immediate defense needs
