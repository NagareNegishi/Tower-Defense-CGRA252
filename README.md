# Game Description
What is the style of the game, what are similar games:
<TEMP>
Our game is a classic 2D Tower Defense (TD) strategy game,
drawing inspiration from popular title Bloons TD.
The game combines strategic placement of defensive structures with resource management (and quick decision-making).
Like Bloons TD, our game will feature a variety of tower types, each with unique abilities and upgrade.
</TEMP>


What is the main game mechanic:<TEMP>

**Pre-round Setup**:
- Players strategically place towers on the map before each wave begins
- Limited resources (money/points) for purchasing and upgrading towers
- Players can sell or relocate towers to adapt their strategy

**Wave-based Enemy Spawns**:
- Diverse enemy types with different speeds, health, and abilities
- Progressively challenging waves that test the player's defense

**Player Base and Health System**:
- Path end that players must protect
- Base health decreases when enemies reach it
- Game over when base health reaches zero

**Tower Mechanics**:
- Multiple tower types (e.g., projectile, area-of-effect, support)
- Upgrade for each tower, enhancing damage, range, or special abilities

**Resource Management**:
- Earn in-game currency by defeating enemies
- Balance between saving for powerful upgrades and immediate defense needs
</TEMP>

A list of the challenging engine technology that will be learnt/used:<TEMP>

**Tower Upgrade System**:
- Implement a flexible superclass for tower upgrades

**Game Balance**:
- Develop a testing framework to balance tower damage with enemy health/scaling

**User Interface and HUD**:
- Create an intuitive, responsive UI for tower placement and upgrades

**Enemy Wave Management**:
- Design a system to manage increasingly difficult enemy waves

(Potentially:
**Multiple Path Implementation**:
- Create a system to support multiple paths for enemies)

## Rubric
<TEMP>
The rubric for this project may be made available in Nuku/Quizzes. However, as of now, it's unclear whether a link will be provided or when it might become available.

In the absence of an official rubric link, we've proposed the following weighting for the project components based on the given ranges:

Our chosen weightings for the rubric:
- Design - Description: X% (20-45)
- Design - Technical: Y% (15-35)
- Group Setup: Z% (20-40)
- Video: W% (5-15)

We will update this section if any official rubric or additional information becomes available.

- Enemy: Creates the enemy system, including different types, movement, and interaction with towers.
- HUD: Designs and implements all UI elements and information display.
- InputController: Manages all user interactions and game controls.
- LevelManager: Handles level progression, wave management, and difficulty scaling.
