# Goblins' Fury: Fortress Fight

## Project Overview
Goblins' Fury is a top-down 2D tower defense game developed in Godot Engine, featuring strategic tower placement and wave-based enemy progression. Originally created as part of a team project at Victoria University of Wellington, this game demonstrates both technical implementation and project management skills.

### My Role: Lead Developer & System Architect
As the lead developer, I:
- Created initial task division and component interaction design
- Established system architecture adopted by the team
- Led documentation efforts (90%+ of project documentation)
- Managed Git workflow and project restructuring
- Implemented core systems including level management, input handling, and tower mechanics

## Technical Implementation

### Core Systems Developed
- **Level Management**: Dynamic difficulty adjustment system based on player performance
- **Input System**: Intuitive tower placement and upgrade mechanics
- **Tower System**: Extensible class hierarchy with multiple tower types
- **Enemy System**: Improved pathfinding and behavior systems
- **Stage Management**: Platform and path system for tower placement
- **HUD System**: Comprehensive game interface and menu system

### Technical Highlights
- **Dynamic Difficulty System**: Implemented sophisticated strength estimation based on:
  - Tower placement analysis
  - Enemy defeat rate calculation
  - Resource efficiency tracking
- **Input Management**: 
  - Preview-based placement system
  - Unified interaction model
  - Centralized upgrade interface
- **Modular Architecture**:
  - Clear separation of responsibilities
  - Signal-based communication
  - Extensible component design

## Game Features

### Core Mechanics
- Strategic tower placement and upgrade system
- Wave-based enemy progression
- Resource management
- Multiple tower types with unique abilities
- Various enemy types with different behaviors

### Tower Types
- **Arrow Tower**: Single-target damage dealer
- **AoE Tower**: Area-of-effect with slow effect
- Upgrade paths for each tower:
  - Attack Speed improvements
  - Range enhancements

### Enemy System
- Multiple enemy types with varying attributes
- Path-following behavior
- Health and speed variations
- Boss-type enemies

## Development Process

### Project Management
- Utilized GitLab's built-in tools for project management
- Implemented comprehensive issue tracking
- Managed merge requests and code reviews
- Coordinated team communication and task distribution
- Led project restructuring when needed

### Technical Challenges Overcome
- Implemented extensible class hierarchy for entities
- Created sophisticated wave generation system
- Developed dynamic difficulty adjustment
- Built intuitive input management system
- Integrated multiple complex systems effectively

## Technologies Used
- Godot Engine
- GDScript
- Git/GitLab for version control
- Pixel art assets (properly credited)

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Open project in Godot Engine
3. Run the main scene
4. Use mouse for all interactions:
   - Left-click to place towers
   - Left-click towers for upgrade options
   - Use UI buttons for wave control

## Development Insights
