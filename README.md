# Game Description
What is the style of the game, what are similar games
- Tower Defense similar to Bloons TD

[THIS IS TEMPORARY]/////////////////
Our game is a classic 2D Tower Defense (TD) strategy game,
drawing inspiration from popular title Bloons TD.
The game combines strategic placement of defensive structures with resource management and quick decision-making.
Like Bloons TD, our game will feature a variety of tower types, each with unique abilities and upgrades.
//////////////////////////////////////////


What is the main game mechanic
- Before each round player sets up and upgrades towers
- Enemies spawn in waves and try to reach players base
- Player takes damage for every enemy that makes it through to base
- When base health reaches 0 game is over

[THIS IS TEMPORARY]////////////////////
**Pre-round Setup**:
- Players strategically place towers on the map before each wave begins
- Limited resources (money/points) for purchasing and upgrading towers
- Players can sell or relocate towers to adapt their strategy
**Wave-based Enemy Spawns**:
- Diverse enemy types with different speeds, health, and abilities
- Progressively challenging waves that test the player's defense
**Player Base and Health System**:
- Path end that players must protect
- Base health decreases when enemies reach it
- Game over when base health reaches zero
**Tower Mechanics**:
- Multiple tower types (e.g., projectile, area-of-effect, support)
- Upgrade for each tower, enhancing damage, range, or special abilities
**Resource Management**:
- Earn in-game currency by defeating enemies
- Balance between saving for powerful upgrades and immediate defense needs
////////////////////////////////////

A list of the challenging engine technology that will be learnt/used.
- Superclass for upgrading towers
- Balancing tower damage with enemy health/scaling

[THIS IS TEMPORARY]/////////////////////////
**Tower Upgrade System**:
- Implement a flexible superclass for tower upgrades
**Game Balance**:
- Develop a testing framework to balance tower damage with enemy health/scaling
**User Interface and HUD**:
- Create an intuitive, responsive UI for tower placement and upgrades
**Enemy Wave Management**:
- Design a system to manage increasingly difficult enemy waves
(Cant remember if we talk about it...
**Multiple Path Implementation**:
- Create a system to support multiple paths for enemies)

## A list of the challenging engine technology currently used.


## A list of the challenging engine technology that will be tested for the rest of the development.


## A list of features that have been implemented in the prototype:

- Basic Level Management: Temp_LevelManager implements a basic structure for managing game levels and waves.

## Prepared but NOT YET IMPLEMENTED Systems:

- GameStats: A system designed for tracking game resources and player stats. This system exists in code but is not yet connected to other game systems or actively tracking any data.

- StrengthEstimator: A framework intended for adjusting game difficulty. While the basic structure exists, it is not yet integrated or influencing gameplay.

- Wave Generation: A basic structure for creating enemy waves has been outlined in code. However, this system is not yet functional or generating actual waves in the game.
