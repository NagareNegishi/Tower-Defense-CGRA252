## Group Contribution

### Contribution to the Group
We only really had 2 meetings(1 in person), I think I was decent at getting my ideas across and making sure I was heard. In terms of code contribution. I definitley could have done better, especially in terms of consitency. I found that I was often leaving it later then I should have to add code to the gitlab. 

### Communication Role and Fulfillment
I would rate my communication about a 2/10. It's something I struggle with that requires alot more work in the future. I was also struggling with my health which had a big impact on my engagements in all courses. It was especially a problem when it came to the group projects because the whole group has to make progress at a consistent pace with eachover.

### Group Dynamics and Teamwork
There wasn't alot of collaboration. I think people tended to take problems in the code into their own hands. It's not a bad thing, it worked for the most part, although I think some of the group may have felt left behind by this, hence the lack of participation.

## Code Discussion

### Project Sections Worked On (with Level of Input)
Outline the parts of the project you were involved in, specifying the level of input:

- **All**
Tower3
Tower4
Tower5
Slimeballs
MagicBalls
- **Some**
Tower1
Tower1_arrows

### Most Interesting Code/Blueprint Section
https://gitlab.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/course-work/cgra252/2024/project/team6/tower-defense/-/blob/main/Tower-Defense-Game/Scripts/Tower/FlyingBalls.gd?ref_type=heads#L16-34
The MagicBalls Rotated around their tower a couple times, dealing damage to monsters that they collided with before they eventually exploded.

### Section You’re Most Proud Of
https://gitlab.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/course-work/cgra252/2024/project/team6/tower-defense/-/blob/main/Tower-Defense-Game/Scripts/Tower/slimeball.gd?ref_type=heads#L11-41
I made a cool little tesla bomb that would take advantage of the alkready implemented arrow mechanics, but instead of taking out a singular target on collision. It would explode and deal damage to all the surrounding enemies aswell. I thought this was a really neat, simple and effective design. 

### Section You Consider Bad Code
I think my tower3 is poorly written, this is because it extends parts of the initial tower class that it doesnt need to in parts. I definitley could have made it alot more compact and cleaner if I had avoided overriding stuff where I didnt need to. However overriding did give me alot more freedom to do what I wanted, the way I wanted. 

### Use of AI and LLMs
I used some ChatGPT during my process, I found it wasn't that effective most of the time, alot of the code it gave was redundant, built for previous versions of godot. Ontop of this It didn't tend to fully grasp node layouts, which made it quite challenging to use.

## Learning Reflection
I think the main takeaway from this project has been the importance of balance in teamwork. This applies not only to those of us who might have lacked participation but also to those who tended to take over other roles. 

Team dynamics can be compared to a scale; lean too far to either side, either by under-participating or overstepping into other roles can throw the whole project off balance. When one side keeps adding, or removing with. The gap between contributions widens, making it harder to maintain cohesion.

At the beginning, the entire group showed up and contributed. However, as the project progressed, we experienced a shift. Some team members started participating less, while others stepped in to fill those gaps. Although this was mostly to pick up extra work left by teammates, I feel like it definitley caused some of our teamates to feel disconnected. I think everyone on the team gained a sense of how important it is to keep our individual contributions balanced, not only for project success but for a healthier team dynamic overall.


### Key Learnings and Development as a Programmer
I learned quite alot about godot during this design process. I think choosing Tower Defense forced you to use alot of the godot features that you would usually have to go out of your way to use. 

### Most Important Takeaway
The most important lesson I learned from this is definitley the importance of balancing the load. This is definitley a difficult one to bring to the future as it requires stepping up and taking a bit of a lead, although I believe it is neccassary in order to be succesful. 

One way I've seen this implemented effectively is by having the entire team agree to a collaborative commitment at the start of the project. For instance, having each member sign a team agreement or contract that outlines their responsibilities, expectations, and commitment to communication. This kind of document keeps everyone accountable and creates an environment where everyone’s contributions can be more consistent. 

I plan to push for similar practices in future projects. Having this balance will hopefully lead to smoother collaboration and help keep everyone on track.
