## Most Interesting Code

The most interesting part of my code is the strength estimation system in `strength_estimator.gd`. This system dynamically adjusts game difficulty by analyzing three key factors:
1. Tower strength (how many towers built)
2. Defeat rate (enemy elimination efficiency)
3. Resource efficiency (gold usage effectiveness)

The system uses these factors and success rate to calculate appropriate difficulty levels
This implementation is particularly interesting because it creates a dynamic difficulty system that responds to player skill and strategy, rather than using a fixed difficulty curve.

## Code I'm Most Proud Of

I am most proud of the Input Management system, particularly the integration between `InputManager.gd` and `UpgradePopup.gd`.

The previous implementation had several issues:
- Drag and drop system caused frequent positioning errors
- Right-click for upgrades was unintuitive
- Upgrade buttons attached directly to towers
- Multiple interaction methods led to user confusion

My reimplementation solves these issues while making the game more intuitive:
- Preview-based placement shows valid positions before placement
- Unified left-click system for all interactions
- Centralized popup system for upgrades instead of attached buttons
- Clear visual feedback (green/red preview) for placement validity

**Code Quality Improvements**:
- Clear separation of responsibilities between input handling and UI
- Efficient signal-based communication between components
- Well-structured and maintainable code

## Problematic Code

The current implementation of `platform.gd` represents poorly written code, despite being functional for the current stage.

**Current Implementation Issues:**
- Simply checks if a point is inside a rectangular StaticBody2D
- Requires manual placement of multiple platforms to create valid tower positions
- Lacks proper path awareness
- Not scalable for different stage designs

**How It Should Be Improved:**
- Platform system should cover the entire stage
- Implement path detection system to automatically identify enemy routes
- Create dynamic "no-build zones" around paths using radius calculations
- Add methods to generate valid tower positions based on path layout

This design would make the code more reusable and allow for easy creation of different stages without manual platform placement.

## AI Tools Usage

- **GitHub Copilot**:
   - Utilized throughout the game development process
   - Particularly useful for:
       - Generating documentation comments
       - Creating repetitive code patterns
       - Syntax checking and basic refactoring
   
   - Less effective for:
       - Creating completely new functions from scratch
       - Often generated overly complex code that didn't match intended design
       - Required careful review and modification of suggestions

   - Overall, while not reliable for core logic implementation, it significantly improved development efficiency for routine tasks and documentation.

- **Claude**:
   - Documentation assistance:
       - Invaluable for non-native English speakers
       - Helped with proofreading and spell-checking
       - Could refine rough drafts into proper documentation
       - Tended to exaggerate achievements (Maybe this is English thing)
       - Required balancing between AI suggestions and personal voice

   - Debugging support:
       - Generated comprehensive debug print statements
       - Helped identify logic errors (boundary conditions, > or >=)
       - Discovered its usefulness in deciphering poorly written existing code during development

   - Code development:
       - Similar to Copilot: sometimes generated overcomplicated solutions
       - Unlike Copilot: could help simplify approaches when asked
       - Required oversight due to limited understanding of full project context

   - Overall highly beneficial, but needed constant validation against project requirements and design intentions


## Learning Reflection

*Note: As the primary author of the group reflection, some of my personal insights naturally overlapped with the group reflection. Here, I focus on my individual growth and specific learnings from this experience.*

### Personal Growth

This project challenged me to develop in multiple aspects of software development.

In technical development, I faced the challenge of integrating multiple complex systems, which taught me the importance of proper planning and documentation. The lack of UML diagrams and common module definitions at the start led to integration difficulties, highlighting how crucial these design elements are. This experience emphasized the value of well-structured code and clear interfaces between components.

The experience of taking over and improving existing code significantly enhanced my refactoring skills, while the need to accommodate future changes pushed me to develop more flexible and maintainable systems.

The project's management challenges led to unexpected learning experiences. As the team became smaller than anticipated, I had to adapt quickly, learning to redistribute tasks effectively and reorganize the project structure to match our available resources. This experience particularly improved my documentation and communication strategies, essential skills for maintaining project progress with a reduced team.

Perhaps most significantly, my approach to problem-solving evolved throughout the project. I discovered the value of abstract development when working with incomplete components, and learned to balance between ideal solutions and practical implementations given our resource constraints. The experience of debugging and analyzing poorly structured code enhanced my ability to understand and improve complex systems.

### Key Takeaway

A key learning came from redesigning the input system, where I learned the importance of user-centric design. By focusing on creating more intuitive and consistent interactions, and refactoring code for future extensibility, I gained valuable insights into how technical decisions directly impact user experience.

The most important takeaway from this project is understanding that successful software development requires both flexibility and solid foundations. While having clear shared understanding and commitment to design rules at the beginning is crucial, equally important is the ability to adapt to changes while maintaining code quality. This means not only being able to adjust to changing team dynamics and requirements, but also consistently focusing on clear documentation, maintainable code structure, and extensible system design. These principles will be essential for any future project, regardless of its scale or complexity.
