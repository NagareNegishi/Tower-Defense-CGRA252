- Aimed to support challenging and interesting ideas
- Advocated for more ambitious approaches:
  - Supported initial proposal to use Unreal Engine for 3D possibilities
  - Encouraged exploring beyond basic TD Balloon inspiration
  - Backed suggestion for multiple enemy path system

#### Role Evolution
As project needs emerged, gradually adopted additional responsibilities:
  - ü¶â Owl: Took responsibility to keep project on track for deadlines

### Group Dynamics

#### Communication Challenges
- Major challenge: Unclear team participation status
  - No authority to confirm member status
  - No means to officially change group composition
  - Non-responding members remained officially in project

#### Communication Platforms
- **Initial Setup**
  - Discord agreed as primary communication platform
  - Attempted to establish regular meetings
    - First two meetings conducted successfully
    - Third meeting never materialized due to declining participation

- **Team Reorganization**
  - Announced changes through both email and Discord
  - Adjusted project scope based on active participation
  - Created new task management system
    - Listed remaining tasks in issues
    - Implemented task claiming system to prevent conflicts

#### Effective Collaboration

## Code Discussion
### Project Contributions

- **Level Management System** (\Scripts\level_manager)

- `game_stats.gd` [All]
    GameStats manages the game statistics such as score, life, and resources



    - LevelManager: Implemented complete game progression system
    - Stage: Developed core stage functionality and path system
    - InputController: Rebuilt tower placement and upgrade system
    - Tower System: Refactored and enhanced tower mechanics
    - Enemy System: Improved existing code with better class structure
    - HUD: Implemented game interface functionality






- documentation:
    most documentation are done by me (over 90%), readme.refrection md

- git use:
    most git planning and managing are done by me too. making issue, milastone, label, tags, managing issue board, release brach

- developed LevelManager:
    as developper initialy assign to develop the system manage game progression(wave creation, difficulty adjustment, game progression, and root of the game which connect everything),
    i developed entire code for that
    all script in LevelManager folder

- reorganized project:
    as we faced lack of participation from team mambers I changed task allocation and way we develop the project meet reality

- stage:
    made all code for stage functions. stage where tower in placed, path which followed by enemy
    all script in stage folder, visual of stage are made by other developper

- tower:
    take over tower development, it already had animation and base code but contained many bugs.
    i refactored code, fixed issue around aiming enemy. imlemented updrade, showing selected, attack range also add class name and made it super class.
    refactored and improved arrow class
    made thouderbolt tower as sub class of tower and thonder bolt for aoe
