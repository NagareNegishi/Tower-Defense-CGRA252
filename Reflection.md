### [Nagare Negishi, üê∂ , LevelManager]

As the team member responsible for the LevelManager component, my experience during this prototype development phase has been both challenging and enlightening:

- Abstract Framework Development: I successfully created an abstract framework for the LevelManager class. This process taught me the importance of designing flexible and scalable systems, even when other components are not yet available. It reinforced my understanding of object-oriented design principles and how to prepare for future integration.

- Adaptation and Integration: Due to the lack of implemented classes, I had to adapt my approach. I created a new class that utilized the spawner system created by another team member for the prototype. This experience highlighted the importance of flexibility in software development and the ability to work with existing code to achieve immediate goals.

- Communication Challenges: I realized the critical importance of clear and consistent communication in a team project. I attempted to establish a system of sharing design intentions and component interactions through GitLab issues. However, these efforts were not as successful as hoped, which impeded our ability to integrate different parts of the system effectively.

- Role Dynamics and Project Management: The animal role system didn't translate effectively to our project. This experience emphasized the importance of early alignment on expectations and consistent contributions from all team members in voluntary group settings.
