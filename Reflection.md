### [Nagare Negishi, üê∂ , LevelManager]

As the team member responsible for the LevelManager component, my experience during this prototype development phase has been both challenging and enlightening:

- Abstract Framework Development: I successfully created an abstract framework for the LevelManager class. This process taught me the importance of designing flexible and scalable systems, even when other components are not yet available. It reinforced my understanding of object-oriented design principles and how to prepare for future integration.

- Adaptation and Integration: Due to the lack of implemented classes, I had to adapt my approach. I created a new class that utilized the spawner system created by another team member for the prototype. This experience highlighted the importance of flexibility in software development and the ability to work with existing code to achieve immediate goals.

- Communication Challenges: I realized the critical importance of clear and consistent communication in a team project. I attempted to establish a system of sharing design intentions and component interactions through GitLab issues. However, these efforts were not as successful as hoped, which impeded our ability to integrate different parts of the system effectively.

- Role Dynamics and Project Management: The animal role system didn't translate effectively to our project. This experience emphasized the importance of early alignment on expectations and consistent contributions from all team members in voluntary group settings.

### [Brock Clarke, üê∞, Enemy logic and HUD]

As the Team memeber initially resposible for the Enenmy spawner/wave system it has been interesting to find out how to spawn multiple enemies off one instance of a path follow2D, This is a part of the game engine I lightly touched on in my first project and something i did initially find quite difficult,
and because of that it is the reason I opted for this task.

As we have had a bit of a lack of commuication towards the project I have also had a hand in implementing the map for the project and working on the HUD, the map was quite simple as I worked with Tilesets in my first project but linking up buttons from the HUD to other scripts within the project have proved to be a challenge, i look forawrd to learning more about how to effectivley implement these an imporve on my current work so far which will be looking more into signals.

Working as a team has also been quite enlightening as said by Nagare that animal system doesnt necessarily work as people fall into thier natural demanors. my role assigned has been the communicator/ facilitator while I dont think my communication has lacked there is certainly room for improvement with this and future projects
